# Sign & Broadcast

## Important to Know

As we know, CosmosKit provide a standard **WalletClient** interface for all wallets. And in this interface, we only provide a single `sign`/`broadcast` method. However, there could be multiple `sign`/`broadcast` methods provided by wallet. i.e. `sign_message`, `sign_transaction`, `sign_amino`, `sign_direct` etc. 

We provide a property `method` in parameter `options` to explicitly designate which method to use in requesting if there are multiple methods available in wallet. This property is optional, and if it's undefined, our **SignParamsDiscriminator** enables wallet client to detect the `params` type and find out the only method fits the `params` type. In this way client determines the particular `sign`/`broadcast` method automatically. (Refer to [examples of SignParamsDiscriminator](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/blob/v2-develop/wallets/cosmostation-extension/src/extension/utils/type-guards.ts) and [map between method and discriminator](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/blob/v2-develop/wallets/cosmostation-extension/src/extension/config.ts) )

However, there are cases that multiple `sign`/`broadcast` methods share the same `params` type, like `personal_sign / eth_sign`, `eth_signTypedData_v3 / eth_signTypedData_v4` in `ethereum` network. Then parameter `options` is required to provide more info.

## WalletConnect

If the doc is hex bytes string and namespace is `ethereum`, make sure `signHexBytes` is set.

**sign options**

```ts
{
    ethereum: {
        signHexBytes: 'personal_sign', // or 'eth_sign', cannot be undefined or null
    }
}
```
