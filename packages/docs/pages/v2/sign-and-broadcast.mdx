# Sign & Broadcast

## Important to Know

As we know, CosmosKit provide a standard **WalletClient** interface for all wallets. And in this interface, we only provide a single `sign`/`broadcast` method. However, there could be multiple `sign`/`broadcast` methods provided by wallet. i.e. `sign_message`, `sign_transaction`, `sign_amino`, `sign_direct` etc. 

To solve this problem, we created **SignParamsValidator** which enables wallet client to detect the `doc` type and find out the only method fits the doc type. In this way client determines the particular `sign`/`broadcast` method automatically. (See [examples of SignParamsValidator](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/blob/v2-develop/wallets/cosmostation-extension/src/extension/utils/type-guards.ts))

However, there are cases that multiple `sign`/`broadcast` methods share the same doc type. Then parameter `options` is required to provide more info.

## WalletConnect

If the doc is hex bytes string and namespace is `ethereum`, make sure `signHexBytes` is set.

**sign options**

```ts
{
    ethereum: {
        signHexBytes: 'personal_sign', // or 'eth_sign', cannot be undefined or null
    }
}
```
